1- create folder for project 
 mkdir monorepo-project 
 cd monorepo-project 

2- initialize yarn for create package.json
yarn init -yp



3- remove main.js and add private true and workspace to package.json
{
  "name": "monorepo-traning",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*",
    "app"
  ],
  "license": "MIT",
}

packages will be created automatically by lerna in step 4
app this is the project we will create  in step 6

4-Then, add lerna and microbundle as workspace dev dependencies and initialize lerna: for create lerna.json and packages folder 
yarn add lerna microbundle --dev -W
lerna init --independent

Lerna creates the packages folder by default and a lerna.json file. 
The independent flag sets the version field in lerna.json, which tells lerna to version the packages independently.


5-Next, modify lerna.json to integrate with yarn:
{
  "version": "independent",
  "npmClient": "yarn",
  "useWorkspaces": true
}

6- in root the folder  create-react-app app
If you look inside demo/node_modules you’ll notice there’s not much in there.
That’s because yarn installed the dependencies in the workspace root node_modules folder to be shared by any packages that need them.


7-In the root package.json, add one script to rule them all:
"scripts": {
  "start": "lerna run start --parallel"
},


8-yarn start
Lerna will kick off the start script (in parallel) for every package. Kill it
